# Principles-of-Programming-Languages

This repository includes projects implemented in the course Principles of Programming Languages using C/C++

# Project 1

- Implemented lexical analysis and extended the provided lexical analyzer to support more token types and implemented various new token types using C++.

# Project 2

- Implemented a C or C++ program that reads a description of a context free grammar, then, depending on the command line argument passed to the program, performs one of the following tasks: 1) for each terminal and non-terminal in the grammar determine the number of grammar rules in which the symbol appears, 2) determine useless symbols in the grammar and remove them, 3) calculate FIRST sets, 4) calculate FOLLOW sets and 5) determine if the grammar has a predictive parser.

# Project 3

- Implemented a predictive parser and write a type checker for a given language. The parser checks the syntax of the input and the type checker enforces the semantic rules of the language. The semantic rules that we are interested in specify which assignments are valid and which expressions are valid.
The input to your code will be a program and the output will be:
1. Error message if there is a type mismatch or syntax error or 
2. Lists of symbols of different types if there is no error.

# Project 4

- Implemented a small compiler for a simple language but not be generating assembly code. Instead, generated an intermediate representation (a data structure that represents the program). The execution of the program is done after compilation by interpreting the generated intermediate representation.
